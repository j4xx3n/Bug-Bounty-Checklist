## **🔐 Broken Authentication & Session**

- Cleartext transmission of session token
	- Log in to site with burp, browse the entire site and check for and session cookies sent over HTTP.
	- Test if site can be accessed through HTTP, login, browse the entire site and check for and session cookies sent over HTTP.
    
- Failure to invalidate session on logout
	- Log out and try to use the old session.
    
- Failure to invalidate session on password reset/change
	-  Reset password and try to use the old session.
    
- Weak login function (over HTTP)
	- Test if login function uses HTTP
	- Test if site can be accessed through HTTP and test login function
    
- Weak registration (over HTTP)
	- Test if signup function uses HTTP. (Check if the token is sent over HTTP)
	- Test if password reset uses HTTP.
	- Test if site can be accessed through HTTP and test signup and password reset.
    

## **🔓 Broken Access Control (BAC)**

- Bypass of password confirmation (change-password endpoint pattern)
	- Login and check it you need to any extra verification to reset password
	- Reference: https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/security/advisories/GHSA-fjh6-8679-9pch
    
- Username/email enumeration (non-bruteforce via response differential)

## **🌐 Server Security Misconfiguration**

- CAPTCHA implementation flaw (detectable only if static or bypassable)
    
- Clickjacking on sensitive action (X-Frame-Options missing)
    - Find pages with sensitive buttons and check for missing X-Frame-Options header.

- DBMS misconfiguration: excessively privileged error pages

- Lack of password confirmation on delete account
	- 

- Missing Cache-Control header on sensitive pages
    
- Mail server misconfiguration – DMARC missing
    
- DNS zone transfer enabled
    
- Missing Secure/HTTPOnly cookie flags
    
- No rate limiting (login, register, email trigger, SMS trigger)
    
- OAuth misconfiguration: account squatting (requires URL pattern checking)
    
- WAF bypass via direct server access (detect alternative hostnames)
    

## **📤 Sensitive Data Exposure**

- Token in URL (user-facing endpoints reveal token)
    
- Token leakage via Referer over HTTP
    
- Token leakage via Referer to untrusted 3rd-party
    
- localStorage/sessionStorage containing sensitive tokens (detectable via JS file scanning)
    
- Visible detailed error/debug page
    
- Password reset token sent over HTTP
    
- EXIF geolocation not stripped (template for file uploads)
    

## **🛜 Insecure Data Transport / Storage**

- Executable download with no integrity check (detect missing checksum/signature)
    
- Sensitive app data stored unencrypted externally (if downloadable)
    
- Server-side credentials stored plaintext (requires known endpoint)
    

## **🧱 Cloud / API Security**

- Misconfigured APIs – insecure endpoints (publicly exposed admin/debug endpoints)
    

## **🧬 Cross-Site Scripting**

- Data URI XSS
    
- Referer-based XSS
    
- Stored XSS (difficult but doable with controlled payload)
    
- UXSS indicators (limited, browser-dependent)
    

## **🪞 Server-Side Injection**

- Email HTML injection
    
- External authentication injection
    
- Broken-link hijacking spoofing
    
- SSTI (basic payload tests)
    

## **🔁 Unvalidated Redirects**

- GET-based open redirect
    

## **🔐 Cryptographic Weakness (Web-detectable only)**

- Use of vulnerable crypto library (detectable via JS fingerprinting)
    
- Expired certificate
    
- Weak PRNG patterns in JS (limited cases)
    
- Predictable IV (if exposed in API responses)
    

_(Excluded deep crypto items like side-channel attacks, PRNG seed size, etc.)_

## **🧩 Insufficient Security Configurability**

- No password policy (detect via weak password acceptance)
    
- Weak password-reset flow (token not invalidated after use)
    
- Weak 2FA implementation (token remains obtainable)
    
- 2FA secret cannot be rotated (if API reveals secret)
    

## **📡 Privacy Concerns**

- Unnecessary data collection (WiFi SSID + password—detect forms requesting it)
    

## **🧪 AI / ML Web-Surface Issues**

(Most AI items are out of scope for Nuclei unless exposed through an API.)

- Improper output handling → Markdown/HTML injection
    
- Rate limiting issues → query flooding/API abuse
    
- Misinformation/wrong factual data → ❌ not automatable
    
- Adversarial example injection → ❌ not suitable for Nuclei
    
- AI misclassification → ❌ not suitable for Nuclei
    

## **📜 Smart Contract / Web3 (If RPC/ABI exposed via HTTP)**

- Improper decimals implementation
    
- Improper modifier use
