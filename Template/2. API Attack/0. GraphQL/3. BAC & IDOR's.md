- [ ] Create two accounts and note the info below:
**User1**
	Username: j4xx3n
	Email: 
	Password: 2yDUQWPztva5


**User2**
	Username: j4xx3n
	Email: 
	Password: 2yDUQWPztva5


- [ ] Create a list of all requests with an object identifier exposed to the user. (Take note of the ID for both accounts)

**Example:**
```json
graphql { 
	user(id: "78901") { 
		username 
		emailAddress 
	} 
}


graphql { 
	order(orderId: "ORD-2025-A3C5") { 
		totalCost 
		shippingAddress 
		trackingNumber
	} 
}
```


**Object ID's**
```json




```

- [ ] Switch all ID's with the other accounts ID and check for information leakage.

- [ ] If you find an IDOR, remove the authentication completely to try to gain unauthenticated access to the data.
